Once the cancer has \u201cmetastasized\u201d it\u2019s much harder to treat then if it was localized.  Currently, surgery is the only long-lasting remedy, where surgeons can go in and get and remove the tumour with clean margins.

Despite the challenges, every dollar raised brings us closer to better treatments and outcomes. Our family will be forever grateful for the support we received from Craig\u2019s Cause and are committed to continuing this important work. We hope our contributions will inspire others to join the fight against pancreatic cancer and bring hope to those who continue to be affected by this devastating disease. Those going through chemo right now; those newly diagnosed, we want improved outcomes for everyone. Together, we can make a difference and honour Heather\u2019s legacy. The journey has been emotional and challenging, but the support from our friends and family has completely humbled us. We are determined to keep Heather\u2019s spirit alive through our efforts and to ensure that future patients have better chances and more support. We are committed to attending future events, engaging more supporters, and spreading the word about the importance of pancreatic cancer research and community awareness. By working together, we can create a lasting impact. The road ahead is long, but with the unwavering support of our community, we are confident that we can make significant strides.

And we also offer numerous patient support programs that are unique to Canada and not offered anywhere else, such as patient support grants, ask a doctor, clinical trial finders, support for caregivers. And we also have a program called \u201cPeers with Pancreatic Cancer\u201d that just started. We have over probably about 30 patients every Monday night that need to share, on their journey to offer advice, to offer inspiration. And, Heather Cutler was one of our patients that attended on a regular basis with her and her family and Heather's daughter, Bethany, is here tonight to say a few words of inspiration to you.Heather was in the hospital exactly this time last year, came out and, participated in our peer support groups. And so here's Bethany, her daughter, just to talk a little bit about why you are all here tonight.  \u00a0 Bethany [00:01:15] Hi everyone. Im Bethany. My dad there and my brother Chris over here. I won't keep you long and its still very fresh, but - we just lost my mom, on May 5th and.. I didn't know anything about Pancreatic Cancer. Mom was perfectly healthy. And she was stage four when she was diagnosed.She just went to the doctor's office, had no idea. And then they said, you know, you you have 15 months. And she ended up living 20 and living well for a really long time which is so important. And the programs at Craig's cause are so good, which is so like the connection that she had with people going through similar experiences. The things that she learned from people. You know, good and bad.  \u00a0 [00:02:06] And I watched her in the weekly support groupShe didn't know anybody. She was too nervous to speak. And I watched her even as she moved through her illness, speak to other people. And they say, you know, have you experienced this? Does anyone have any suggestions? Mom would say, well, I tried, and I would suggest and watching her be able to help people, even as she moved through her illness was just incredible. And Craig\u2019s cause, the programs are just so good. They're so important. We need more research. We we need more advocacy, and we need more solutions. And Craig\u2019s Cause is working towards that. So thank you all for coming out. I thought about the rain. One last thing. I thought about the rain. And I said, oh my gosh, if I had to walk five kilometers in the rain. And then I thought about my mom, who did a year and a half of chemo every two weeks. And she never complained. She never said, why me? And I said, if mom could do that for so long, I can do five kilometers in the rain and everybody here can as well. So thank you so much. \u00a0 \u00a0 Host [00:03:06] Thank you. \u00a0 Host [00:03:07] So the Cutler family doesn\u2019t know this yet, but they\u2019ve fundraised, I think, close to ten thousand dollars so Craig\u2019s Cause has informed us they will be rewarding a research grant in Heather\u2019s name. \u00a0"", ""locationCreated"": ""http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7271817"", ""duration"": ""PT3M49S"", ""editor"": {""@type"": ""Person"", ""url"": ""https://heathercutler.ca/author/christopher/"", ""alternateName"": ""Chris Cutler"", ""sibling"": ""https://heathercutler.ca/author/bethany-cutler/#Person"", ""additionalName"": ""Kesen"", ""parent"": [{""@type"": ""Person"", ""url"": ""https://heathercutler.ca/about/"", ""sibling"": [""https://heathercutler.ca/author/keith/#KeithBurry"", ""https://heathercutler.ca/author/dave/#AuthorImage""], ""spouse"": ""https://heathercutler.ca/author/barry/#BarryCutler"", ""parent"": [""https://heathercutler.ca/author/peter/#PeterBurry"", ""https://heathercutler.ca/author/jennie/#JennieBurry""], ""image"": ""https://heathercutler.ca/content/images/size/w2000/2024/05/IMG_0997-1.jpeg"", ""name"": ""Heather Cutler"", ""description"": ""Heather Cutler passed away on May 5, 2024 surrounded by her family and beloved dog, Yuki.

Knowing our efforts could positively impact pancreatic cancer patients made us immensely proud.

Despite the challenges, every dollar raised brings us closer to better treatments and outcomes. Our family will be forever grateful for the support we received from Craig\u2019s Cause and are committed to continuing this important work. We hope our contributions will inspire others to join the fight against pancreatic cancer and bring hope to those who continue to be affected by this devastating disease. Those going through chemo right now; those newly diagnosed, we want improved outcomes for everyone. Together, we can make a difference and honour Heather\u2019s legacy. The journey has been emotional and challenging, but the support from our friends and family has completely humbled us. We are determined to keep Heather\u2019s spirit alive through our efforts and to ensure that future patients have better chances and more support.

And we also offer numerous patient support programs that are unique to Canada and not offered anywhere else, such as patient support grants, ask a doctor, clinical trial finders, support for caregivers. And we also have a program called \u201cPeers with Pancreatic Cancer\u201d that just started. We have over probably about 30 patients every Monday night that need to share, on their journey to offer advice, to offer inspiration. And, Heather Cutler was one of our patients that attended on a regular basis with her and her family and Heather's daughter, Bethany, is here tonight to say a few words of inspiration to you.Heather was in the hospital exactly this time last year, came out and, participated in our peer support groups. And so here's Bethany, her daughter, just to talk a little bit about why you are all here tonight.  \u00a0 Bethany [00:01:15] Hi everyone. Im Bethany. My dad there and my brother Chris over here. I won't keep you long and its still very fresh, but - we just lost my mom, on May 5th and.. I didn't know anything about Pancreatic Cancer. Mom was perfectly healthy. And she was stage four when she was diagnosed.She just went to the doctor's office, had no idea. And then they said, you know, you you have 15 months. And she ended up living 20 and living well for a really long time which is so important. And the programs at Craig's cause are so good, which is so like the connection that she had with people going through similar experiences. The things that she learned from people. You know, good and bad.  \u00a0 [00:02:06] And I watched her in the weekly support groupShe didn't know anybody. She was too nervous to speak. And I watched her even as she moved through her illness, speak to other people. And they say, you know, have you experienced this? Does anyone have any suggestions? Mom would say, well, I tried, and I would suggest and watching her be able to help people, even as she moved through her illness was just incredible. And Craig\u2019s cause, the programs are just so good. They're so important. We need more research. We we need more advocacy, and we need more solutions. And Craig\u2019s Cause is working towards that. So thank you all for coming out. I thought about the rain. One last thing. I thought about the rain. And I said, oh my gosh, if I had to walk five kilometers in the rain. And then I thought about my mom, who did a year and a half of chemo every two weeks. And she never complained. She never said, why me? And I said, if mom could do that for so long, I can do five kilometers in the rain and everybody here can as well. So thank you so much. \u00a0 \u00a0 Host [00:03:06] Thank you. \u00a0 Host [00:03:07] So the Cutler family doesn\u2019t know this yet, but they\u2019ve fundraised, I think, close to ten thousand dollars so Craig\u2019s Cause has informed us they will be rewarding a research grant in Heather\u2019s name. \u00a0"", ""locationCreated"": ""http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7271817"", ""duration"": ""PT3M49S"", ""copyrightHolder"": {""@id"": ""https://heathercutler.ca/about-us/#PersonHeatherCutler""}, ""@id"": ""https://heathercutler.ca/team-heather-raises-almost-ten-thousand-in-support-of-craigs-cause/#VideoObject""}, {""@context"": ""http://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""VideoObject"", ""name"": ""Celebrating the Life of Heather Cutler"", ""thumbnailUrl"": ""https://heathercutler.ca/content/images/size/w2000/2024/07/IMG_5275.jpeg"", ""copyrightYear"": ""2024"", ""description"": ""A nurse of twenty-five years, a loving Mother and Wife, a dedicated friend, and an unexpected warrior\u2014Heather Cutler embodied resilience and compassion.

I stand and watch her until, at length, she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come to mingle with each other.  Then, someone at my side says, \"There, she is gone.\" Gone where?  Gone from my sight. That is all. She is just as large in mast, hull and spar as she was when she left my side. And, she is just as able to bear her load of living freight to her destined port. Her diminished size is in me -- not in her. And, just at the moment when someone says, \"There, she is gone,\" there are other eyes watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout, \"Here she comes!\"  BARRETT\u2019S MEMORIAL CHAPEL FRIDAY, MAY 10, 2024  GONE FROM MY SIGHT  HEATHER CUTLER  MUSICAL PRELUDE SOLO REFLECTION PRAYER OF THANKSGIVING PRAYER OF JESUS OPENING PRAYER (IN UNISON) HYMN WORDS OF REMEMBRANCE PRAYER FOR HEALING AND RENEWAL READINGS  A service of remembrance and thanksgiving Celebrating the life of NOVEMBER 26, 1960 to MAY 5, 2024  May 10, 2024, at 2:00 P.M., Barrett\u2019s memorial chapel  Officiant: rev. rebecca pike accompanist: gillian vaughan soloist: anne marie cox urn bearers: david burry and christopher cutler honor guard: viola finn, dianna peddle, margie munch, cathy tilley, janet brown and linda thorne  O God, creator of all life, help us to accept death as a part of life, trusting in your goodness and great love for every one of us. we feel now the pain of parting with a loved one, but we rejoice that we/so many were privileged to experience life with her. we entrust heather to you in death as in life you entrusted her to us. we pray in sincerity and hope. amen."", ""creditText"": ""\u00a9 2024 Heather Cutler Foundation."", ""copyrightNotice"": ""\u00a9 2024 Heather Cutler Foundation."", ""name"": ""Celebrating The Life of Heather Cutler Booklet"", ""description"": ""A commemorative booklet detailing the celebration of life service for Heather Cutler, including prayers, hymns, and words of remembrance."", ""dateModified"": ""2024-07-02"", ""@id"": ""https://heathercutler.ca/celebrating-the-life-of-heather-cutler/#CreativeWork""}"
